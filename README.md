### Entity Relationships

- **User to Client**: One-to-Many (A user can have multiple clients)
- **User to Project**: One-to-Many (A user can have multiple projects)
- **Client to Project**: One-to-Many (A client can have multiple projects)
- **User to Interaction**: One-to-Many (A user can log multiple interactions)
- **Client to Interaction**: One-to-Many (A client can have multiple interactions)
- **Project to Interaction**: One-to-Many (A project can have multiple interactions)
- **User to Reminder**: One-to-Many (A user can set multiple reminders)
- **Client to Reminder**: One-to-Many (A client can have multiple reminders)

- Foreign keys ensure referential integrity:
  - `userId` in Client, Project, Interaction, and Reminder tables
  - `clientId` in Project, Interaction, and Reminder tables
  - `projectId` in Interaction and Reminder tables
- Soft deletion is implemented for data recovery purposes

## Module Descriptions

### Authentication Module
The authentication module handles user registration, login, and profile management. It uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and bcrypt for password hashing. This module ensures that only authenticated users can access protected resources.

### Client Module
The client management module allows users to create and manage their client database. Users can add detailed client information including contact details and notes. All client data is associated with the authenticated user, ensuring data privacy.

### Project Module
The project module enables tracking of client projects with details such as budget, deadline, and status. Projects are linked to specific clients and the authenticated user. The status of a project can be tracked from NOT_STARTED through to COMPLETED.

### Interaction Module
The interaction module records all communications with clients, including calls, emails, meetings, and other types of interactions. These interactions can be associated with specific clients and/or projects, creating a comprehensive communication history.

### Reminder Module
The reminder module helps users stay organized by setting reminders for follow-ups with clients or project deadlines. Reminders include a title, description, due date, and completion status. They can be linked to specific clients and/or projects.

### Dashboard Module
The dashboard provides an overview of the user's CRM data, including client counts, project statuses, upcoming reminders, and recent interactions. This gives users a quick snapshot of their business activities.

   git clone https://github.com/mdalaminfaraji/crm-be.git
   cd crm-be
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

5. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Database Schema

The database schema includes the following models:

- **User**: Stores user authentication and profile information
- **Client**: Stores client information
- **Project**: Tracks projects with their status, budget, and deadlines

- **Reminder**: Sets reminders for clients and projects

## Development

- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Start**: `npm start`
- **Development**: `npm run dev`

## Security

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Protected routes with middleware
- Input validation with Zod
- Data isolation (users can only access their own data)
